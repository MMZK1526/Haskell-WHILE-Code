:) Calculates the number of transformation needed to turn a positive integer to
:) 1 with the collatz sequence.
if x < 1: :) the colon can be omitted 
  -1 :) same as return -1; indicating an error
c := 0
while x != 1:
  isEven := x % 2 == 0
  if isEven:
    x := x / 2
  else:
    x := 3 * x + 1
  c := c + 1
c
